3D Design of Workbench

### Pragmatic Approach to Workbench Building

 * Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that considers ideas as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.

 Using a pragmatic approach, I asked the question - what is the primary purpose of a workbench?

 * Workbenches are meant to hold and provide a flat space for work.  Fundamentally, the most, "workbenchy," aspect of a workbench is their immovable top surface.
 * The ideal workbench would simply be a flat surface of a given width and length, with no legs, just floating in space, completely rigidly, able to withstand the force of a million exploding suns without deviating or vibrating even a nanometer - in short, a perfect, ideal surface.
 * Failing the capability to have an imaginary flat surface, we can work backwards from available materials and try to get the closest we can to a flat surface.
 * Things like fixtures, storage, gadgets and widgets are all superfluous, non-workbenchy and can be figured out later, but are not the focus of the design.
