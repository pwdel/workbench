3D Design of Workbench

### Pragmatic Approach to Workbench Building

 * Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that considers ideas as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.

 Using a pragmatic approach, I asked the question - what is the primary purpose of a workbench?

 * Workbenches are meant to hold and provide a flat space for work.  Fundamentally, the most, "workbenchy," aspect of a workbench is their immovable top surface.
 * The ideal workbench would simply be a flat surface of a given width and length, with no legs, just floating in space, completely rigidly, able to withstand the force of a million exploding suns without deviating or vibrating even a nanometer - in short, a perfect, ideal surface.
 * Failing the capability to have an imaginary flat surface, we can work backwards from available materials and try to get the closest we can to a flat surface.
 * Things like fixtures, storage, gadgets and widgets are all superfluous, non-workbenchy and can be figured out later, but are not the focus of the design.

##### Notes

* The feet might be too big and get in the way of moving around the bench.  Need to be adjustable.
* Need wooden dowels to keep everything stable.
* Height should be around 29 or 30 inches, to keep it in line with desks that have been comfortable to use in the past.
* Lip should be adjustable.

* Making the feet adjustable makes creating the support holes to an exact dimension complicated. Need to double check feet support hole dimensions.
* Making lip adjustable makes table width complicated.  Need to fix table width dimensions.
* Rather than building up multi-variable distance calculations for every leg, foot and brace, we can specify a distance variable on a drawing and use those all-encompassing distance calculations, knowing that OpenScad calculates everything from the, "bottom right," dimension of a given part, starting at coordinate [0,0].
* Looking at a design and realizing that it "feels," discombobulated should be celebrated, not mourned. A confused or disjointed design means that we took risks and attempted to be creative earlier on rather than designing for safety and laziness of design.
